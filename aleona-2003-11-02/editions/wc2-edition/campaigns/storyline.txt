FcMP WC2 Edition Storyline
==========================

Hi! This is what I (Wolfgang Köhler) planned as story for the FcMP WC2 Edition.
These are only my thought, maybe you have better ideas, then please tell me.
Forgive me also my bad grammar and style, I'm no native english speaker.

Alliance Campaign

After many years of war, the different human and other people had made peace
and formed an alliance. Many decades of peace passed by until once some
mysterious creatures attack a human town near the Seawill Forests.
Some troops are sent to it to save the raided town.
Included in these troops is the brave Arthor Literios, which already
survived dozens of battles. He is one of the most experienced fighters the
Human Kingdom has.
But the way through the Seawill Forests is already been blocked by some of these
creatures, which must be annihilated to secure the town.

After the troop reach the town, an outpost must be constructed near the town,
and some further footman be trained to secure it and to be able to defend
the Mythicals' assault.

The Mythicals' attacks become stronger and stronger, and so Arthor finally
decides to evacuate the town and flee over the sea. Unfortunately, the way to
the next place near the sea is again infested by these Mythicals, which must
again be killed in order to reach the sea.
As these mythicals seem to be everywhere, they might even already hold the sea,
so you have to build some destroyers to be prepared to attacks by the Mythicals
coming from the sea.

After the destroyers are ready and everything is prepared for the exodus, you
suddenly notice that you were right with your assumption: The Mythicals do
indeed already possess the sea and have built up a strong army.
They are much stronger than your forces, so you decide to ask your Elvish allies
for navy reinforcement, but until their destroyers and transporters arrive to
help you defending and fleeing to the forsaken dunes of Almador, you have to
survive the heavy assault of the Mythicals.
