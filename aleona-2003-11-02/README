Aleona's Tales
==============

Aleona's Tales is a collection of graphics, sounds and music that are
useable with the Stratagus engine.


Installation
============

To compile Aleona's Tales, simply run:

  ./buildfcmp.sh STRATAGUSDIR

where STRATAGUSDIR is the directory where the 
stratagus src directory is located, eg '~/stratagus',
default is try to autodetect.

This will create the data directory: './data.aleona'

You can then run it by specifying the '-d' option to the stratagus binary, 
eg: '~/stratagus/stratagus -d ~/aleona/data.aleona'

NOTE: the UI is only updated for 640x480 resolution, 
so the UI at all the other resolutions looks messy.
