CONTRIBUTING:
----------------------------------------
Please check out the FcMP (Freecraft Media Project) home page for how
to submit new media (graphics/sounds/puds/campaigns/etc).
The highest priority is creating replacement media for those that are 
'faked'.  Improved media is also welcome.  And ANY new sounds and graphics
can always be used... even new races can be added.

The prefered format is RGB png.

ANY GRAPHICS THAT ARE MODIFICATIONS OF ANY COMMERCIAL GAME WILL BE REJECTED.  

Please tell me who created the graphics.  

Graphics sent to the FreeCraft project MUST be modifiable and redistributable. 
I will assume that they can be distributed under the following license or/and
